            I started out as a construction engineer major, but I realized it
            was not the right fit for me. With my family&apos;s encouragement, I
            decided to pursue my high school dream of creating a website where
            users could listen to music and chill.

            My journey in software development began with C/C++ language on
            Console. I found it fascinating and not as hard as some people might
            think. I was very keen on learning algorithms, data structure, OOP,
            and design patterns... and that helped me land a fresher job at
            Nashtech company, one of the top technology companies in Vietnam, in
            2018. That&apos;s when everything took off.

            I could say I am very fortunate in my IT career with my hard work
            and now I have reached some achievements. The foundation knowledge
            that I gained at HCM University of Science has been very useful. My
            key is very simple: you must understand what you are doing and then
            you will know how to do it in the best.

            I am a new immigrant in Canada and I am searching for my first job
            opportunity here. I would greatly appreciate any referrals.
